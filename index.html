    <h1>Derrick Price's Learning Log</h1>
    
    <h2>Mozilla MDN</h2>

    <h3>Intro</h3>

    <p>In this section we went over basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I think I have coded in JavaScript before in college after spending some time with it. HTML and CSS seem to be pretty easy languages to get a hold of. HTML I did in high school a bit, but this is my first time really ever looking at CSS.</p>

    <p>I did a few different learning assignments in this. Most of it I was familiar with I believe. They also covered how the web works and all that which I already knew.</p>

    <h3>HTML</h3>

    <p>9.5.22 I'm struggling to find the motivation to keep going through the HTML MDN articles. The reading is getting a little redundant. A lot of the same topics are being revisited. Today I'm reading about links. I think the learning activity is a navigation bar. So that'll be interesting I guess.</p>

    <p>I got as far as Advanced text formatting today.9.5.22. The link stuff was mostly known already. I didn't know how to link to specific headings, but now I do. So that's interesting. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Advanced_text_formatting
    </p>

    <p>Update: I continued to read a bit later tonight on my phone. I didn't do much in the assessments. I'm going to do the projects now.</p>
