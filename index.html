    <h1>Derrick Price's Learning Log</h1>
    <h2>Mozilla MDN</h2>
    <h3>Intro</h3>
    <p>In this section we went over basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I think I have coded in JavaScript before in college after spending some time with it. HTML and CSS seem to be pretty easy languages to get a hold of. HTML I did in high school a bit, but this is my first time really ever looking at CSS.</p>
    <p>I did a few different learning assignments in this. Most of it I was familiar with I believe. They also covered how the web works and all that which I already knew.</p>
