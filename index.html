    <h1>Derrick Price's Learning Log</h1>
    
    <h2>Mozilla MDN</h2>

    <h3>Intro</h3>

    <p>In this section we went over basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I think I have coded in JavaScript before in college after spending some time with it. HTML and CSS seem to be pretty easy languages to get a hold of. HTML I did in high school a bit, but this is my first time really ever looking at CSS.</p>

    <p>I did a few different learning assignments in this. Most of it I was familiar with I believe. They also covered how the web works and all that which I already knew.</p>

    <h3>HTML</h3>

    <p>9.5.22 I'm struggling to find the motivation to keep going through the HTML MDN articles. The reading is getting a little redundant. A lot of the same topics are being revisited. Today I'm reading about links. I think the learning activity is a navigation bar. So that'll be interesting I guess.</p>

    <p>I got as far as Advanced text formatting today.9.5.22. The link stuff was mostly known already. I didn't know how to link to specific headings, but now I do. So that's interesting. 
    </p>

    <p> 9.8.22 I got through all of the intro to html. Now I'm moving into the multimedia area. It doesn't seem to be as large. Rn we are learning about the image tags and such.

    <p> I did finish the multimedia and embedding portion. The responsive images area was a little confusing to be honest. I should go back to that. I also need to do the assessment. This weekend I should do all of the assessments and see what I retained.</p>
    
    <p>I'm now 9.8.22 starting the tables section! I've done this table stuff with the Hopkins website!</p>
    
    
    
    
    <table>
        <caption>Lame</caption>
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th colspan="4"">Big Heading</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
<tbody>
        <tr>
        <th rowspan="3">Second<br>big<br>heading</th>
        <th>&nbsp;</th>
        <th> heading 1</th>
        <th> heading 2</th>
        </tr>
    
        <th> Heading 3</th>
        <td> cell1</td>
        <td> cell2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>heading 4</th>
            <td> cell3</td>
            <td> cell4</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
        <tfoot>
            <td colspan="4">yo</td>
        </tfoot>
    </table>



    <p>9.8.22 Alright, I finished the tables section. This was pretty easy and I've used it quite a bit already. I didn't do the assessment. I'll do that this weekend. I think I'm going to redo this entire site this weekend too. We'll see though. I've finished HTML and I'm on to CSS!!!</p>
